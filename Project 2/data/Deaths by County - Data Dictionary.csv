Field Title,Field Name,Data Type,Description
Year,Year,Number,Four-digit year in which the event occurred.
Month,Month,Number,Two-digit month in which the event occurred. Records without valid months are excluded from reports by month but included in reports by year. The sum of counts by month for a given year may not equal the annual count.
County Name,County,Plain Text,Name of county for geography.
Geography Type,Geography_Type,Plain Text,"Whether the geography is based on the place of residence or place of occurrence. A geography type of Residence includes events for California residents even if they occurred outside of California, whereas a geography type of Occurrence includes events that occurred within California even if they were not California residents."
Strata,Strata,Plain Text,"General demographic or detail category under which events have been stratified. For example, Race-Ethnicity or Gender. Will be Total Population if there is no stratification other than underlying cause of death."
Strata Name,Strata_Name,Plain Text,"Individual strata within the general demographic or detail category. For example, Hispanic or Female. Will be Total Population if there is no stratification other than underlying cause of death."
Underlying Cause of Death,Cause,Plain Text,"Cause of death category based solely on the underlying cause of death as coded by the International Classification of Diseases. The underlying cause of death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ""the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury."" It is a single value assigned to each death based on the details as entered on the death certificate. When more than one cause is listed, the order in which they are listed can affect which cause is coded as the underlying cause. This means that similar events could be coded with different underlying causes of death depending on variations in how they were entered. Consequently, while underlying cause of death provides a convenient comparison between cause of death categories, it may not capture the full impact of each cause of death as it does not always take into account all conditions contributing to the death. Provided as a three-character code: ALL = All causes (total); ALZ = Alzheimer's disease [G30]; CAN = Malignant neoplasms (cancers) [C00-C97]; CLD = Chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) [J40-J47]; DIA = Diabetes mellitus [E10-E14]; HOM = Assault (homicide) [*U01-*U02, X85-Y09, Y87.1]; HTD = Diseases of heart [I00-I09, I11, I13, I20-I51]; HYP = Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease [I10, I12, I15]; INJ = Accidents (unintentional injuries) [V01-X59, Y85-Y86]; LIV = Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis [K70, K73-K74]; NEP = Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis [N00-N07, N17-N19, N25-N27]; PAR = Parkinson's disease [G20-G21]; PNF = Pneumonia and influenza [J09-J18]; STK = Cerebrovascular disease (stroke) [I60-I69]; SUI = Intentional self-harm (suicide) [*U03, X60-X84, Y87.0]. The previously included OTH category for all other causes of death is no longer provided. This value can be calculated from the difference of ALL and the sum of all other categories. Cause of death categories for years 1999 and later are based on tenth revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes listed. Comparable categories are provided for years 1979 through 1998 based on ninth revision (ICD-9) codes and for 1970 through 1978 based on the eighth revision adapted (ICDA-8) codes. For more information on the comparability of cause of death classification between ICD revisions see Comparability of Cause-of-death Between ICD Revisions (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/comparability_icd.htm)."
Underlying Cause of Death Description,Cause_Desc,Plain Text,Descriptive text for the cause of death category.
ICD Revision,ICD_Revision,Plain Text,The revision of the International Classification of Diseases used for coding the cause of death. For more information on the comparability of cause of death classification between ICD revisions see Comparability of Cause-of-death Between ICD Revisions (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/comparability_icd.htm).
Count,Count,Number,"Count of events. If blank, see annotation for more information."
Annotation Code,Annotation_Code,Plain Text,Annotation code for count as single digit: blank = no annotation; 1 = cell suppressed for small numbers; 2 = cell suppressed for complementary cell; 3 = no data is available; 4 = statistically unstable value.
Annotation Description,Annotation_Desc,Plain Text,Descriptive text for the data annotation.
Data Extraction Date,Data_Extract_Date,Date,"For provisional data, date when the data was extracted (MM/DD/YYYY). Provisional counts are based on the data available when the data was extracted and may not represent all events that occurred during the time period."
Data Revision Date,Data_Revision_Date,Date,Date data was created or revised (MM/DD/YYYY).
